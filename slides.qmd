## RNA base pairs

- Given orientations, the edges and base pairing, there are more than **200** possible base pairs.

- The standard WC base pair corresponds to the cis WC/WC pairing.

# Experimental methods 

## Experimental methods 
### Macromolecular X-ray crystallography (MR)

- Most widely used technique
- A crystal is exposed to an X-ray beam. 
- Diffraction images are collected with rotation of the crystal. 
- Application of inverse Fourier to find strucutre

## Experimental methods 
### Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)

- Observe local magnetic fields around atom and measure interactions between them
- Atoms carry magnetic that take various orientations characterized by different energies when applied to magnetic field. 

## Experimental methods 

### Electron microscopy (EM)

- Rely on the constrast formed by the interaction of incoming electrons 
- Multiple 2D projection images of randomly oriented molecules are recorded
- 3D density map is computationally combined

## Experimental methods 
![](img/experimental_methods.png){fig-align="center"}

## Experimental methods 

- Experimental methods exist but are laborious and of high cost (in **time** and **money**)

- Computational methods aim to predict RNA 3D structures with high throughput

. . .

**Question**: How to compute RNA 3D structures ? 

# RNA 3D structures prediction

## RNA 3D structures prediction

### General pipeline 

Models that predict RNA 3D structures use this general workflow: 

- Generate RNA 3D candidates 
- Selection of good candidates (structure evaluation)
- Refinement: relaxe the structures 
- Final prediction: return either the best structure or multiple structures

## RNA 3D structures prediction

Methods can be divided into 3 classes: 

- ***Ab initio*** (physics-based): use of thermodynamic and physics
- **Template-based**: use of fragment assembly
- **Deep learning**

# Ab initio
## Ab initio

- Rely on the fact that native structures are those states with the lowest energies for RNAs
- The energy used usually consider **dihedral angles**, **bond length**, **base pairing**, ...
- Use a **generation** process and a **discriminator**
- Use Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics (MD) sampling procedures

## Ab initio
### Coarse-grained 

- All-atom simulation can be time-consuming
- Use of coarse-grained to reduce computation time 

. . . 

![](img/cg.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}


## Ab initio
### RNAJP granularity

- 5 pseudoatoms (beads) to represent a nucleotide

. . . 

![](img/rnajp_nucleotides.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

## Ab initio
###  RNAJP granularity

- Use the 2D structure to represent CG helix as A-form helix

. . .

![](img/rnajp_helix.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}


## Ab initio
### RNAJP force-field

- Force-field uses 12 terms:
$$
E_{total} = E_{bond} + E_{angle} + E_{torsion} + \\
            E_{base-pairing} + E_{base-stacking} + \\ 
            E_{excluded-volume} + \\
            E_{A helix} + E_{helix-helix}+ E_{junction-compact} + \\
            E_{JAR3D} + E_{loop-loop} + \\
            E_{PK stacking}
$$


## Ab initio
### RNAJP force-field

- $E_{bond} + E_{angle} + E_{torsion}$: bonded interactions in terms of bond length, angle and torsion
- $E_{base-pairing} + E_{base-stacking}$: important base pairing and base stacking interactions
- $E_{excluded-volume}$: avoid steric clashes between beads
- $E_{A helix} + E_{helix-helix}+ E_{junction-compact}$: use to accelerate the conformational sampling


## Ab initio
### RNAJP force-field

- $E_{JAR3D} + E_{loop-loop}$: describe the intraloop and interloop interactions
- $E_{PK stacking}$: describe the stacking interaction between the pseudoknotted (PK) helix and its adjacent non-pseudoknotted (nonPK) helix


## Ab initio
### RNAJP sampling

- Sampling procedure: molecular dynamics (MD) 
- Procedure: 
    - Generate an initial 3D structure
    - Fold the helices in the given 2D structure 
    - Fold the hairpin and internal loop structures 
    - Sample different junction topologies and junction loop structures

## Ab initio
### RNAJP: model selection

- Select the lowest-energy structure as the first predicted model
- Among a pool of top 1% low energy, select the structure with the largest RMSD from previous selected structure
- Select the structure among the top 1% low-energy structures with the largest sum of RMSDs relative to the first and second models as the third model
- Continue until N predictions


## Ab initio
### RNAJP: all-atom reconstruction

- CG beads aligned in the standard base
- Selection of reconstructed atoms after superimposition


## Ab initio
### RNAJP: refinement

- Fix the broken bonds and remove steric clashes using QRNAS (@qrnas)


## Ab initio
### Limits

- Limited by the sequence length (increase computation time) 
- Require efficient sampling function (to avoid useless computation)
- Methods usually slow 


# Template-based

## Template-based

- Creation of 3D structures from known structures (templates) 
- Use of fragment mapping between 2D and 3D
- Align the target sequence to the template
- Structure evaluation to choose the best candidate


## Template-based
### Granularity 

- Looking to template at the nucleotide level is time consuming
- Sample the space not at the atom level but at the level of basic block

## Template-based
### Granularity 
- Basic blocks can be:
    - Three-nucleotides (used in FARNA)
    ![](img/tp_3nt.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## Template-based {transition="none"}
### Granularity 
:::{.nonincremental}
- Basic blocks can be:
    - Three-nucleotides (used in FARNA)
    - Smallest Secondary Elements (SSEs)
:::

![](img/tp_sses.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## Template-based
### Example: 3dRNA

![](img/3drna_workflow.png){fig-align="center"}


## Template-based
### Example: 3dRNA

- Assembled structures are clustered by K-means
- Use RMSD values to do the clustering 
- Centroids of each cluster are evaluated by 3dRNAscore

## Template-based
### Limits

- Rely on representative templates
- Fail to generalise to unseen structures
- Limited by the number of available RNA

# Towards deep-learning

## Towards deep-learning
### Proteins 

- AlphaFold 2(Jumper et al., 2021) has successfully predicted protein 3D structures

. . .

![](img/alphafold.png)


## Towards deep-learning
### Proteins 
AlphaFold not adapted to RNAs:

- RNAs composed of nucleotides (compared to amino acid)
- Disparity in length for RNAs
- Multiple structures possible for RNAs
- Fewer structures available
- AlphaFold is based on Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), but not all RNA families are known

## Deep learning

- Recent works try to reproduce AlphaFold
- Remain limited: works not published (only preprint)

![](img/drfold_fape.png){fig-align="center"}

## Deep learning 
### DRfold loss

$$
L_{e2e} = 1.5 L_{FAPE} + 0.6L_{dist}
$$

with 
$$
L_{dist} = - \sum_{i,j} \sum_{b=1}^{36} y_{ij}^b \log p_{ij}^b
$$

$y_{ij}^b$ assesses if the distance of atom pair $(i, j)$ in the target experimental structure falls into the $b$-th distance

## Deep learning
### DRfold: dataset

- Training set of 3864 unique RNAs extracted from the PDB
- Test set on 40 non-redundant RNAs
- RNA length from 14 to 392 nucleotides

## Deep learning 
### DRfold: results

## Deep learning
### DRfold

- Use of full-atom reconstruction
- Training took 2 weeks on Nvidia A40 GPUwith 32GB of memory
- RNA sequences of 200 nucleotides maximum
- **Doesn't use MSA nor self-distillation**

## Deep learning
### Limits

- Overall performance of deep learning approaches still to be improved
- Lack of sufficient solved structures
- Interpretation of the model
- Integration of environment conditions (ions ?)


# RNA quality measurement
## RNA quality measurement

![](img/1d_2d_3d_evaluation.drawio.png){width=200%}

- Evaluation of raw sequence or 2D structure is accessible (F1-score, MCC, ...)
- RNA 3D structures are complex objects: hard to evaluate (pairing, geometries, etc)

## RNA quality measurement

![](img/rp14f_pred.drawio.png){width=20% fig-align="center"}

**Given a structure, how to assess its quality ?**

## Metrics
### Definition
:::: {.columns }

::: {.column width="50%" }

#### Predicted structure
![](img/rp14f_pred.drawio.png){width=50% fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" }

#### Reference structure
![](img/ref_rp14f.drawio.png){width=50% fig-align="center"}

:::
::::

**Metrics**: Quality measurement given a solved structure

## Metrics 
### General metrics

- **RMSD**: Atom deviation 
- **CLASH** (@molprobity): Steric clashes     
- **$\epsilon$RMSD** (@barnaba): Relative distance

## Metrics 
### Protein-based 

- **GDT-TS** (@gdt): Superimposed residues 
- **TM-score** (@tm-score-rna): Largest deviation 
- **lDDT** (@lddt): Interatomic distance 
- **CAD-score** (@cad-score): Contact-area 

## Metrics 
### RNA-oriented

- **INF, DI** (@inf): Key interactions accuracy 
- **P-VALUE** (@p-value): Non-randomness
- **MCQ** (@mcq): Angle deviations

## Metrics
### Example: Interaction Network Fidelity

$$
INF = \sqrt{( \frac{TP}{TP+FP}) \times (\frac{TP}{TP + FN})}
$$
with TP the true positive of the considered interactions 

- When the model reproduces exactly the reference interactions,
|TP| > 1 and FP = FN = 0.  -> The INF value equals 1

## Metrics
### Example: Interaction Network Fidelity
- If none of the interactions of the reference is reproduced in
the predicted model, |TP| = 0, and the INF score equals 0. 

- INF score can be specific to base-pairing interactions ($INF_{bp}$), the base stacking interactions
($INF_{stack}$), or consider both ($INF_{all}$ )


## Metrics

- Metrics help to evaluate a prediction given a solved structure
- No universal metric exists: RMSD is mainly used (but sensible to outliers)

- **Metrics requires having a solved structure, which is not available when model development**


# Scoring functions
## Scoring functions

![](img/scoring_fig.drawio.png){fig-align="center" width=105%}

 
- When developing models, a lot of structures can be generated and should be ranked
- Ranking can be used to return multiple structures

. . . 

**Scoring function**: predict the quality of a structure **without a known reference**

## Scoring functions
### Knowledged based

Scoring function based on knowledge-based statistical potentials

- **RASP** (@rasp): Pairwise-distances
- **$\epsilon$SCORE** (@barnaba): Relative positions
- **3dRNASCORE** (@3drnascore): Distance/dihedral angles
- **DFIRE-RNA** (@dfire-rna): Pairwise-distances
- **rsRNASP** (@rsrnasp): Short/long pairwise distances


## Scoring functions
### Deep learning based

Scoring functions based on deep learning architectures

- **RNA3DCNN** (@rna3dcnn): Atom grid
- **ARES** (@ares): Atom position/chemical type

## Scoring functions
### Example: RNAD3DCNN

- Predict for each nucleotide an unfitness score
- The unfitness is based on the RMSD of its surroundings and its RMSD 
- A score of 0 means the nucleotide fits into its environment perfectly (native conformation)
- For global quality assessment, the unfitness scores of all nucleotides are accumulated

## Scoring functions
### RNAD3DCNN: inputs

- For each nucleotide, a box of 3 channels represents:
    - Atomic occupation number
    - Mass
    - Charge within the grid box
- A box is of size 32x32x32
- The RGB channels are mapped to the three channels
